        <h3>Study Abroad</h3>
        <p>This trip to Ireland truly did challenge everything I had gathered during my years in the University of Missouri. Not only did it challenge me academically, but it challenged me as a person as well. The academic challenge was a given. This was my capstone and it almost felt like 3-4 classes in one; applying everything I had learned in my academic career in one project. I was prepared as I could have been for the academics, but not for the personal challenge. The culture shock of being so far from home with people I did not know very well weighed heavy on me. During my four-week trip, I dealt with a lot of loneliness and personal growth. This struggle helped me see life a bit differently and really taught me perseverance and what real ambition looked like. </p>
        
        <h3>Technical Response Team Supervisor</h3>
        <p>During my half decade of working for the Division of Information Technology, I was able to gain tons of real experience as well as a chance to apply technicalities that I had learned in classes. Not only did I gain experiences, but I met tons of different people all over campus and made a lot of different connections. I truly do believe that my time in the IT program would not have been near as successful as it is if I did not have this job to apply what I had learned. I have made several friends from this job and have the potential to have a career with the division if I chose to. </p>

        <h3>Internship</h3>
        <p>This internship was a huge step up from my student job. From the internship, I was given a real glimpse of a career in information technology. It felt very good knowing I could handle nearly all the tasks I was given by my superiors while being a student still. This boast of confidence was right where I needed it as well. Being a graduating senior is very nerve wracking to me. Because of this internship, I was given a new hope as I am nearing entering the workforce. Overall, I am extremely grateful to the University of Missouri Division of Information Technology.</p>

        <h3>Overall</h3>
        <p>Throughout my years in the Information Technology program at the University of Missouri, I have learned many different things that are going to help me in my professional career. These experiences and lessons are going to help me reach my goals one day. These goals of mine include becoming a master of my work as well as being successful no matter where I end up. I am extremely grateful for all of the good, the bad, the easy, the difficult; every task and experience I encountered along the way. Looking back on the time I spent working for the university, through my job or in class, will truly help give me the headstart I need as I approach graduation in the near future. </p>
