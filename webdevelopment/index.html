These works include a variety of projects that I created for a plethora of classes I had taken. After viewing this website, the user should have an understanding of what I am capable of creating. Another goal will be to have an understanding of my character and an understanding of my ambitions. This website will give a brief summary of my career and show how I have honed my skills over the past half decade here at the university. </p></div>
