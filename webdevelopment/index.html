        The purpose of this website is to display some of my best work that I had created as a student as well as experiences I had gained in the Information Technology program at the University of Missouri. These works include a variety of projects that I created for a plethora of classes I had taken. After viewing this website, the user should have an understanding of what I am capable of creating. Another goal will be to have an understanding of my character and an understanding of my ambitions. This website will give a brief summary of my career and show how I have honed my skills over the past half decade here at the university.
