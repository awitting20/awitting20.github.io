        <h4>Study Abroad 2023: Dublin, Ireland</h4>
        <p>In the summer of 2023, I traveled to Dublin, Ireland with the Information Technology program leaders. This trip was for my capstone. For my capstone, we studied the local Holidays and Festivals and used the information we gathered to create an immersive and informative experience. My team created 3D models of artifacts and statues we encountered throughout our exploration of Ireland that were in-line with our theme of Irish Holidays and Festivals. We used these models in Unity Game Engine and created a virtual museum. This project was one of my favorite projects that I had created in my time in the IT program.</p>

                our project:

        <h4>University of Missouri Division of IT</h4>
        <p>Since February 2020, I have been employed by the Division of Information Technology. I had a family member that helped me gain employment here my senior year of high school and I have worked there since. My official title is a Technical Response Team Supervisor. The technical response team (TRT for short) is a small branch of the division, made up of student employees. TRT students do a handful of different tasks including machine delivery, software/hardware installation, and managing devices. I was elevated to supervisor of TRT in May of 2023. As a supervisor, I review tickets with IT related requests and assign/dispatch students to resolve said tickets.</p>

        <h4>Mizzou IT Internship</h4>
        <p>During the fall semester of 2023, I was permitted to take an internship with the Division of Information Technology. I say “permitted,” because I applied for permission to get credit hours during the internship. I spent 320 total hours at my internship, boiling down to 20 hours a week for 16 weeks. This internship was similar to my normal job with the division, except I was given higher priority tasks with higher risk. For example, I led a research project assessing the WiFi strength of all of the buildings that the university owned. I use an AI program to create a heat-map of Wifi strength on every floor of every building. This was one of my favorite projects I had the privilege of working on during my time in my internship.</p>
